// EstateMotion — /api/curate-photos
//
// "AI hand-picks the best 24 photos and arranges them in a strong real-estate
// tour order." User uploads N photos (up to 60). OpenAI Vision scores each
// one for real-estate marketability, then we pick the top 24 with mandatory
// room coverage and order them as a professional walkthrough.
//
// Flow:
//   1. Accept up to 60 photos with durable URLs.
//   2. Send all of them to gpt-4.1-mini (Vision) at "low" detail. ~$0.002/img,
//      so a 50-photo curation costs ~$0.10. Budget-friendly.
//   3. Model returns per-photo: roomType, quality (0-100), pickWorthiness
//      (0-100), one-line rationale, isHero flag.
//   4. We apply the picker:
//        - Mandatory rooms first (exterior > kitchen > living > primary
//          bedroom > bathroom > outdoor) — at least one of each if available.
//        - Fill remaining slots with highest pickWorthiness, capped per room
//          (no 5 bedroom photos in a 24-scene tour).
//        - Sort the chosen 24 into tour order.
//   5. Return { curated: [{photoId, order, roomType, score, reason}],
//                rejected: [{photoId, reason}] }.
//
// Why this is its own endpoint (not folded into /api/create-edit-plan):
//   - Lets the user curate first, see the picks, swap any out, THEN render.
//   - Curation runs in seconds; edit-plan generation takes 30+ seconds. They
//     have different UX expectations.
//   - Keeps the cost gate clear: curation is one Vision call; edit-plan is
//     another. Each can be metered independently if we add quotas.
