/* =================================================================
   v26.0 — Veo 3.1 Fast prompt system (Phase 2 engine swap)

   Veo differs from Runway in three ways that shape these prompts:
   1. It follows the prompt LITERALLY — and the Jan-2026 Veo 3.1 update
      sharpened that further. Naming camera equipment ("tripod", "dolly",
      "slider") or a filming scenario ("documentary footage", "social
      reel") makes Veo RENDER it — a tripod, a crew, an operator — into
      the room. v27: describe camera MOVEMENT and the property as a
      "film" only; never name a rig or a shoot. (The June-9 bake-off ran
      on the older, less-literal Veo, which is why "locked tripod" passed
      then and hallucinates now.)
   2. It rewards scene-level art direction (lighting, atmosphere,
      lens feel), so style notes are written as a DP would brief.
   3. No 1000-char API limit, so we don't have to choose between
      motion vocabulary and constraints. The universal fidelity
      clause is appended WORKER-SIDE (VEO_FIDELITY_SUFFIX in
      runway-job.mjs) so it can never be dropped by prompt assembly.
   ================================================================= */
// v27 hallucination fix: motion described as camera MOVEMENT only, never by
// equipment ("dolly", "slider", "tripod"). The Jan-2026 Veo 3.1 update sharply

// operator). These describe the move and the stability, with no nouns to render.
